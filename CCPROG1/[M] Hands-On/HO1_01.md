# **Hands-On 01: Linear Equations**
## I. Introduction
A linear equation $y=mx+b$ consists of a slope $m$ and its y-intercept $b$. When graphed, a non-vertical line is produced by the equation. However, when two linear equations, $y_1 = m_1x+b_1$ and $y_2 = m_2x+b_2$, are graphed, three possible results can occur:
- There is **exactly one solution**, that is there exists a point $(x,y)$ intersecting both equations.
- There is **no solution**, where the lines are parallel when both have equal slopes, denoted by $m_1 = m_2$.
- There are **infinitely many solutions**, where the lines have equal slopes and y-intercepts, denoted by $m_1 = m_2$ and $b_1 = b_2$.

## II. Task
Create a program that takes in the slopes and y-intercepts of the two linear equations, and displays a solution, if it exists. If it does not exist, display the appropriate error (e.g. No Solution, Infinite Solutions).


## III. Sample Test Cases
These are sample test cases that can be used to simulate the program and check the correctness of the program.
