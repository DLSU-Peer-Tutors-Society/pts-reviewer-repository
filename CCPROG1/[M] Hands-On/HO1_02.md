# **Hands-On 01: Parking Fee**
## I. Introduction
Different rates are applied to a vehicle parking in a mall, depending on how long they stay in the parking area. Mall ABC is a famous mall in the Philippines that opens every 9:00 AM and closes at 8:00 PM. For their parking policy, they allow vehicles to leave the parking anytime, but can only enter during mall hours.

For Mall ABC, their parking rates are as follows:
| Fee | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| Php 30.00  | Fixed fee for the first three hours |
| Php  5.00  | Succeeding rate added to the total fee for every hour and remaining excess minutes once the first three hours have been exceeded.|
| Php 200.00 | Overnight fee when vehicle has stayed on and beyond 00:00, on top of the existing parking fee |

## II. Task
In order to compute the parking fee faster, you are tasked to create a program that takes the time a vehicle went in the parking and the time they left the parking area. Ensure that the inputs are valid to be able to do the necessary computations on the fee.

## III. Sample Test Cases
These are sample test cases that can be used to simulate the program and check the correctness of the program.
