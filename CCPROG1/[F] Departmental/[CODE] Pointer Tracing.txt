CCPROG1 Reviewer - Tracing (T1 SY23-24)


Concepts Tackled: functions, conditionals, pointers
 
Instructions:


Given the function changeVal(), trace the program to determine the output of main().


In doing so, you must provide the answers the following questions:


1. What are the initial values of each pointer in the code?
2. What is the output of the first printf()?
3. What is the output of the second printf()?
4. What would the main()'s output be if "x, y, z" were all defined with an integer value of 3?


REMINDERS:
        DO NOT COMPILE AND EXECUTE THE PROGRAM!
