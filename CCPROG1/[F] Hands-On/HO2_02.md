# **Hands-On 02: Display Sequence**
## I. Introduction
Using `*` characters and numbers, you can make unique outputs, depending on the algorithm. Using the integer `31234`, you can make the following outputs:
```
3 ***
1 *
2 **
3 ***
4 ****
```
```
31234
*****
* ***
*  **
    *
```
## II. Task
Create a program that takes a positive integer as input and displays the required sequence output. The input must not contain any zeroes as a digit. An example of the display sequence is seen on the test cases below.

## III. Sample Test Cases
These are sample test cases that can be used to simulate the program and check the correctness of the program.

```
TEST CASE 01
---
Number: 31234
123456789
  *
*
 *
  *
   *
```
```
TEST CASE 02
---
Number: 11223789
123456789
*
*
 *
 *
  *
      *
       *
        *
```
