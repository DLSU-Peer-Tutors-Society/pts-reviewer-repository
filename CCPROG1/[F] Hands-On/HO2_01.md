# **Hands-On 02: Number Systems**
## I. Introduction
A number system with base $b$ contain digits from $0$ to $(b-1)$. An example is the binary number system of base `2` with digits `0` and `1`, which form binary numbers such as `00101` or `11010`.

## II. Task
Create a program that takes in the base of a number system and a number from the number system and displays a message that determines whether a number is part of that system or not.

For simplicity, ensure that the base input is from `1` to `10` only.

## III. Sample Test Cases
These are sample test cases that can be used to simulate the program and check the correctness of the program.

```
TEST RUN 01
---
Base: 4
Number: 21323000
Number is part of Base-4 Number System.
```
```
TEST RUN 02
---
Base: 5
Number: 123450
Number is not part of Base-5 Number System.
```
```
TEST RUN 03
---
Base: 8
Number: 22456177
Number is part of Base-8 Number System.
```
